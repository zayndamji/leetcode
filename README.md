# How to Navigate

At the root level, there is a folder for each language in which I have solved Leetcode problems. \

In each language folder, there is a file for each problem I have solved in that language. The filename specifies the problem number and name, as specified in Leetcode. \

In each problem file, I place each of my solutions, one after another, with comments seperating them. If I only solved it once, I do not have a specific identifying comment for the solution. There are also comments at the top specifying problem URL, language, memory, and speed of program execution. \
